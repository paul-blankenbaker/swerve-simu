# swerve-simu
Simulation of swerve drive wheels to experiment with control settings without a FRC robot

This repository contains example source code for working with and visualizing the wheels on a swerve robot.

The code in this repository deals with how you go from user inputs to directions and linear velocities for each of the swerve modules on the robot. Much of the math used in this code is based off diagrams and formulas found in the document titled "Crash Course in Swerve Drive" document by Jaci R Brunning, Feb 22nd 2017, Rev 1.1 (unfortunately, the PDF rendering of the document I have makes no indication as to whether the document can be freely redistributed).

The code and documentation in this repository is freely available under the MIT License.

While the code found here can be useful in determining the direction and speed for the wheels on a swerve bot, the actual motor control and positioning is left up to the end user.
